# Face_Detection
This Python script uses MTCNN for face detection from either a live webcam stream or an image file. For webcam input, it continuously captures frames, detects faces, and annotates them with bounding boxes and facial keypoints. For image input, it detects faces in the image and provides bounding boxes and a count of detected faces.
